# Preface

“There is remarkably little correlation between innate mathematical
ability and capacity to understand the ordinary biometric methodologies.
By contrast, in our experience a very high correlation exists between
success in biometry course and success in the chosen field of biological
specialization.”

# 1 | Introduction

“There are still a few legitimate fields of inquiry in which, from the
nature of the phenomena studied, statistical investigation is
unnecessary. When all animals given injections of a pathogenic organisms
contract the disease, while none of the controls fall ill, statistical
testing is hardly needed. Much more frequent, however, are
investigations, such as those determining the relation betweens smoking
and heart disease, where the variability of the outcomes necessitates
statistical analysis.”
